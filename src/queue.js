 *  - no task priorities
 *  - only one unnamed task queue (=worker pool)
 *
 * This emits:
 *   'created', taskId -- when a task becomes pending
 *   'claimWork', workerId -- when a worker calls claimWork (whether it gets work or not)
 *   'started', taskId, workerId -- when a task is claimed
 *   'resolved', taskId -- when a task is resolved
